## Day 1
Got reminded of it late.  
## Day 2
Mind immediately went to the `re` module.  If there was ever an opportunity for 
me to make it to the main leaderboard it would've been today.  And I was still no where close.
## Day 3
## Day 4
Oh boy!  Day 4 is where I start to get in trouble.  Disclaimer: I sort of 
cheated.  I knew I was only off by one and my code was too much spaghetti 
to find my mistake, so I just entered the right answer without working code.

I went with a brute force approach with regexp and if conditions.  In 
hindsight I could have replaced all the if statements with better regexp.

I'm going to want to come back to this one.

## Day 5
Did a lousy job parsing the puzzle...both parts.  It wasn't until about halfway 
through my solution that I realized I could do it without all the dumb array 
stuff I was doing.  There was a simple, math based solution.  But I continued 
on the path I was on.  

This sentence in part 2:
> Your seat wasn't at the very front or back, though; the seats with IDs +1 and -1 from yours will be in your list.

Was difficulty for me to parse.  I couldn't understand what it was trying to 
tell me.  So I just printed the available seats and hoped one would stand out 
to me.  One did.  The result also illuminated the sentence.

Things I learned in day 5:
* I don't parse the puzzles well and this leads me to bad solutions

## Day 6
It is better to sleep in that obsess about the private leaderboard.  But Day 6 
fun.  I thought my solution was easy, didn't turn out so easy.  I learned 
somethings about sets I didn't previously know discard("some value").  
And I changed my data file reading to match what I saw people doing in 
day 4, and it really helped me here.

Things I learned in day 6:
* I don't think as clearly when I have company.
